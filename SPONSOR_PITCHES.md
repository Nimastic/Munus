## 🏪 BASE - Small Business Track ($1,000)

### The Vibe: **Practical, Real-World, Accessible**

**Opening:**
> "Base asked: how do we help small businesses get onchain? Here's our answer."

**The Problem They Care About:**
"Remote teams and freelancers are small businesses. A 5-person design agency is a small business. A solo developer taking client work is a small business.

They all face the same problem: coordinating paid tasks is a nightmare. Invoices, payment delays, platform fees. It's messy, it's slow, and it blocks them from earning."

**Your Solution:**
"Munus makes it dead simple:

1. **Post a job in chat** - Your team is already there
2. **Funds lock on Base** - $0.001 transaction cost, not $40
3. **Worker delivers** - Instant verification
4. **Payment releases** - Automatic, trustless

No invoicing software. No payment processor. No waiting 14 days for PayPal.

This is crypto being **useful** - not just novel."

**Why Base?**
"We deployed on Base specifically because:
- **Fast**: 2-second blocks, perfect for micro-tasks
- **Cheap**: $0.001 per transaction makes $10 jobs profitable
- **Built for builders**: Your miniapp infrastructure made this possible

Our escrow contract at `0x265B042A...` handles ETH and ERC-20s. Full ReentrancyGuard protection. Deadline-based refunds. Production-grade security."

**Target Market:**
- Remote teams (2-50 people)
- Freelance designers, developers, writers  
- Creator economy (commission artwork)
- Small agencies coordinating client work

**Real Business Value:**
- ✅ No 20% Upwork fees
- ✅ No 3% Stripe fees
- ✅ International payments (no borders)
- ✅ Works in their existing group chats

**The Close:**
"This isn't a demo. It's deployed. It works. Teams can use it today.

Small businesses don't need complexity. They need tools that just work.

That's Munus on Base."

## 🤖 AI × Web3 Track ($1,500)

### The Vibe: **Technical, Innovative, Real Integration**

**Opening:**
> "Most 'AI×Web3' is a chatbot with a wallet. This is different."

**The Technical Reality:**
"We built a GPT-4o agent that **actually orchestrates blockchain state**.

Not just 'tell me about ENS' - real function calling that:
- Queries smart contracts
- Filters on-chain data
- Generates transaction parameters
- Creates miniapp links for signing

This is AI as infrastructure, not as toy."

**How It Works:**
```
User: "Show me design jobs under 0.01 ETH"

AI Agent:
1. Calls getOpenJobs() → queries Base contract
2. Filters by category + price
3. Resolves ENS names for creators
4. Formats with job details
5. Returns: "3 jobs found - vitalik.eth needs logo design..."

User: "I'll take job 1"

AI Agent:
1. Checks eligibility (job still open?)
2. Generates transaction params
3. Returns: "Click to accept: [miniapp-url]"
4. User signs → AI posts receipt to XMTP
```

**The AI Stack:**
- **Vercel AI SDK** - Function calling infrastructure
- **GPT-4o** - Natural language understanding
- **Custom Tools** - Contract query functions:
  - `getOpenJobs()` - Browse marketplace
  - `getJobDetails(id)` - Inspect job
  - `getMyJobs(address, type)` - User's work
  - `acceptJob(id)` - Generate tx link

**Multi-Step Reasoning:**
The agent doesn't just answer questions - it plans workflows:

```
User: "What are my pending jobs?"

Agent reasoning:
1. Need user's address (from context)
2. Query jobs they created (getMyJobs)
3. Filter by state=Delivered
4. For each, check deadline
5. Format with urgency markers
```

**Why This Matters:**
"This is the future of Web3 UX:
- Natural language → Blockchain actions
- AI handles complexity
- Users just... talk

No more MetaMask dropdowns. No more confusing contract calls.

Just: 'I want to accept this job' → Done."

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Type-safe function schemas
- ✅ Error handling & retries
- ✅ Context-aware responses
- ✅ Production-deployed on Railway

**The Close:**
"AI×Web3 isn't about chatbots. It's about AI that **does things** onchain.

We built that. It works. Try it."

## 🔐 CIVIC - AI-Ready Web3 App ($2,000)

### The Vibe: **Frictionless, User-First, Perfect Compliance**

**Opening:**
> "You asked for Civic as the **only** SSO. We delivered."

**Perfect Compliance Checklist:**

✅ **Civic Auth as ONLY SSO**
```tsx
// Zero alternative auth
// No email/password, no social logins, no Web3 wallet auth
<CivicAuthProvider clientId={CIVIC_CLIENT_ID}>
  <UserButton /> {/* Only authentication option */}
</CivicAuthProvider>
```

✅ **Embedded Wallets**
- Auto-created on first login
- No seed phrase management
- Civic handles security
- Users don't even know it's crypto

✅ **Civic Nexus Integration**
- Agentic transaction flow
- AI generates tx → User signs with Civic wallet
- Seamless Web2→Web3 bridge

- Fully functional
- Test it right now

✅ **Demo Video**
- 3 minutes
- Shows complete flow
- Highlights Civic integration

**The Agentic Flow:**

```
1. User logs in with Civic (one tap)
   → Embedded wallet created

2. User chats with AI agent
   User: "I want to accept job 1"
   
3. AI checks eligibility
   → Queries contract
   → Validates job state

4. AI generates transaction link
   → Miniapp URL with params
   → User clicks

5. User signs with Civic wallet
   → Frictionless signing
   → No seed phrase needed

6. Transaction confirmed
   → AI posts receipt
   → Everyone updated
```

**Why This Wins (Judging Criteria):**

**Integration Quality (60%):**
- ✅ Smooth: One-tap Google login
- ✅ Intuitive: Users don't realize it's Web3
- ✅ Frictionless: Zero crypto knowledge needed
- ✅ Correct: Perfect implementation, zero workarounds

**Use Case (20%):**
- ✅ Creative: Agentic job coordination

**The User Experience:**

Traditional Web3:
```
1. Download MetaMask (5 min)
2. Save seed phrase (scary!)
3. Buy ETH (complicated)
4. Switch networks (confusing)
5. Approve transaction (what am I signing?)

= 20 minutes, 5 opportunities to quit
```

With Civic:
```
1. Click "Login with Civic"
2. Tap Google
3. Done.

= 10 seconds, zero confusion
```

**What Makes This Special:**

"Civic isn't just for authentication - it's the **foundation** of our UX.

Without Civic:
- We'd need user education
- Seed phrase management
- Network switching UI
- Scary confirmation dialogs

With Civic:
- One-tap onboarding
- Invisible wallet management
- Automatic everything
- Web2-grade UX

This is what 'Web3 for everyone' actually looks like."

**Technical Details:**
- Client ID: `ac368fe8-81ea-4cd4-8a08-465bea0d20da`
- Domain configured: `munus-miniapp-jo66.vercel.app`

## 🏷️ ENS - Identity Layer ($2,000)

### The Vibe: **Social, Human, Identity-First**

**Opening:**
> "Blockchain addresses are ugly. ENS makes them human. We made ENS social."

**The Problem:**
"Job marketplaces need trust. But how do you trust `0xd8dA6331...`?

You don't. It's just numbers. No reputation, no identity, no humanity."

**The Solution:**
"ENS everywhere:

Instead of this:
```
Job #0: Design Logo
Creator: 0xd8dA6331...
Worker: 0x1234abcd...
Reward: 0.01 ETH
```

You see this:
```
Job #0: Design Logo
Creator: vitalik.eth 👤
Worker: nick.eth 👤
Reward: 0.01 ETH
```

Suddenly it's not crypto - it's people."

**Where ENS Appears:**

1. **Homepage** - Connected wallet shows as ENS
2. **Job Board** - Every creator & worker
3. **Job Details** - Full profiles with avatars
4. **Agent Receipts** - "vitalik.eth accepted Job #0"
5. **Everywhere** - All addresses resolve

**Technical Implementation:**
```tsx
// EnsBadge component
const { data: ensName } = useEnsName({
  address: creator,
  chainId: 1,  // L1 mainnet (ENS home)
});

const { data: avatar } = useEnsAvatar({
  name: ensName,
  chainId: 1,
});

// Display
{avatar && <Image src={avatar} />}
{ensName || "0x1234...5678"}  // Graceful fallback
```

**The User Experience:**

**Without ENS:**
- "Should I trust 0xd8dA... to deliver?"
- No reputation
- No recognition
- Just random numbers

**With ENS:**
- "Oh, vitalik.eth posted this! I know that name"
- Reputation tied to identity
- Recognizable creators
- Social proof

**Real Impact:**

"ENS doesn't just make addresses pretty - it fundamentally changes behavior:

1. **Workers build reputation**
   - Complete jobs under your .eth name
   - Your name = your brand
   - Repeat clients find you easily

2. **Creators trust recognizable names**
   - Hire people you've worked with before
   - Check other jobs they've done
   - ENS = portable reputation

3. **Social sharing works**
   - 'Check out this job by vitalik.eth'
   - Not 'check out 0xd8dA...'
   - Names are shareable

4. **Avatars humanize the platform**
   - See faces, not hex
   - Feels like a team, not code
   - Profile pics = trust"

**Why This Qualifies (Pool Prize):**

"You said: 'Build anything and integrate ENS'

We built a job marketplace where ENS is the social layer:
- ✅ Name resolution on L1 mainnet
- ✅ Avatar display everywhere
- ✅ Graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Core to user experience
- ✅ Makes crypto feel human

This isn't ENS tacked on. This is ENS as infrastructure."

**The Comparison:**

| Platform | Identity |
|----------|----------|
| Upwork | Email + profile |
| Fiverr | Username + reviews |
| **Munus** | **ENS name + avatar** |

"We're using decentralized identity for a decentralized marketplace. It's perfect alignment."

**The Close:**
"ENS makes blockchain social. We made a social job marketplace.

Every address you see has a name. Every name has a story.

That's ENS making Web3 human."

## 💬 XMTP - Group Chat Miniapp + Agent SDK ($3,000)

### The Vibe: **Chat-Native, Daily Use, Real Utility**

**Opening:**
> "Most apps add chat. We started with chat and built everything around it."

### Track 1: Best Miniapp in Group Chat ($1,500)

**The Daily Use Case:**

"Your team has a group chat. That's where you coordinate everything.

Someone needs a logo? Post it in chat.
Found a bug? Post it in chat.  
Need content written? Post it in chat.

Why should payment be different?"

**How It Works:**

```
[Team Group Chat]

Alice: "Need someone to design a logo - 0.01 ETH, 24 hours"

@munus bot: "📋 Creating job..."

@munus bot: "🎯 Job #0 Posted!
Title: Design logo
Reward: 0.01 ETH
Deadline: 24 hours

[Accept Job] [View Details]"

Bob: *clicks [Accept Job]*

@munus bot: "✅ Bob accepted Job #0! 
Funds locked in escrow. Get to work!"

[24 hours later]

Bob: "Delivered! Here's the final design"

@munus bot: "📦 Job delivered!
Alice, review and release payment"

Alice: *clicks [Release Payment]*

@munus bot: "💰 Payment Released!
0.01 ETH → Bob
Job #0 complete! 🎉"
```

**Why Groups Love It:**

1. **Zero Context Switching**
   - Don't leave chat to manage jobs
   - Payment happens where work happens
   - One app, one thread

2. **Shared Visibility**
   - Everyone sees job posted
   - Team knows who's working on what
   - Public accountability

3. **Quick Actions**
   - Tap to accept
   - Tap to release
   - Tap to view
   - No forms, no hassle

4. **Viral Mechanics**
   - Team member accepts job → Others see it works
   - Word spreads through groups naturally
   - Network effects built-in

**Real Use Cases:**

- **Design teams**: Post client work, divvy it up
- **Dev teams**: Bug bounties in chat
- **Content teams**: Quick writing gigs
- **Agency teams**: Coordinate freelancers
- **Friend groups**: Split work, split pay

**The Close (Track 1):**
"You asked: what would your group use every day?

This. Coordinating paid work without leaving chat.

It's not a game. It's not a novelty. It's utility."

});
```

**5. AI-Powered Responses ✅**
```typescript
const tools = [
  {
    name: "getOpenJobs",
