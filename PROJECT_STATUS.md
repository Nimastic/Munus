## 🚀 **What Works Right Now**

### **Full User Flow:**

1. **User** goes to miniapp → Logs in with Civic (ONLY SSO)
2. **User** connects wallet (MetaMask/Coinbase) on Base Sepolia
3. **User** creates job with 0.01 ETH reward
4. **Contract** locks funds in escrow
5. **Agent** posts "New Job Created!" in XMTP chat
6. **Worker** accepts job in miniapp
7. **Agent** posts "Job Accepted!" in chat
8. **Worker** delivers with SHA-256 hash
9. **Agent** posts "Job Delivered!" in chat
10. **Creator** releases payment
11. **Agent** posts "Payment Released!" in chat
12. **Everyone** happy! 🎉

### **AI Agent Flow:**

1. **User** DMs agent: "What jobs are available?"
2. **AI** understands intent
3. **AI** calls `getOpenJobs()` tool
4. **Tool** queries Escrow contract on Base Sepolia
5. **AI** receives job data
6. **AI** formats natural response:
   ```
   Here are the open jobs:
   
   Job #0
   💰 Reward: 0.0100 ETH
   ⏰ Deadline: 1/19/2025, 12:00 PM
   ```
7. **User** can ask follow-ups, AI maintains context

## ⚠️ **Known Limitations**

### **1. Calimero**
- **Issue:** Needs actual Docker + Merobox install to run workflow
- **Workaround:** Workflow YAML is ready, verification script works
- **Impact:** Medium (nice-to-have, not blocking)

### **2. Quick Actions Codec**
- **Issue:** Infrastructure ready, but actual `ActionsCodec`/`IntentCodec` not wired to XMTP SDK
- **Workaround:** Buttons work as text fallback
- **Impact:** Low (works, just not pretty in Base App yet)

### **3. OpenAI API Key**
- **Issue:** User needs to add their own key to test AI agent
- **Workaround:** Simple agent works without AI
- **Impact:** None (user-provided)

### **4. Production Deployment**
- **Issue:** Not deployed to Railway/Vercel yet
- **Workaround:** Full deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- **Impact:** Low (can deploy in 30 mins)
