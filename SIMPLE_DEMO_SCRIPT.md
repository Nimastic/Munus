# Munus - Simple Demo Script
**Just read this while you demo. 3 minutes.**

---

## [0:00-0:20] INTRO

"Hi, I'm [your name] and this is Munus.

Freelancers wait days for payment. Teams waste hours switching between apps. 

What if you could post a job, coordinate the work, and pay someone... all in chat?

Let me show you."

---

## [0:20-0:40] LOGIN

**[Open munus-miniapp-jo66.vercel.app]**

"Here's our app. First, I login with Civic."

**[Click "Login with Civic"]**

"One tap with Google. Civic creates an embedded wallet automatically. No seed phrases, no complexity."

**[Login, then click "Connect Wallet"]**

"Now I connect my Web3 wallet for signing transactions."

**[Connect MetaMask]**

"Done. That's the entire onboarding."

---

## [0:40-1:20] CREATE JOB

**[Click "Create Job"]**

"Let's post a job. I need a logo designed."

**[Fill form:]**
- Description: "Design minimalist logo for my startup"
- Reward: 0.01 ETH
- Deadline: 24 hours

"I submit this to our escrow contract on Base Sepolia."

**[Click "Create Job", approve transaction]**

"Funds are now locked in the smart contract. The money is safe until the work is delivered.

And our AI agent automatically posts this to XMTP group chats where workers can see it and accept."

---

## [1:20-1:50] BROWSE JOBS

**[Click "Browse Jobs" or navigate to /jobs]**

"Here's the job board. Notice something special here?

**[Point to ENS names]**

These aren't just wallet addresses like 0x123456. Those are ENS names - vitalik.eth, nick.eth - real identities.

This makes the marketplace feel human. You can build reputation with your ENS name."

**[Click on a job]**

"Let's accept this job."

**[Click "Accept", approve transaction]**

"Transaction confirmed. The AI agent posts a receipt to the chat. Everyone knows I'm now working on this."

---

## [1:50-2:20] DELIVER & PAY

**[Navigate to job detail, click "Deliver"]**

"After I complete the work, I deliver it. 

Here's where Calimero comes in - I can process sensitive files locally on my machine, generate a cryptographic attestation, and only the CID goes on-chain.

So if it's confidential work, the actual files never leave my computer. Privacy preserved."

**[Submit delivery]**

"Delivered. Now the creator reviews and releases payment."

**[Click "Release Payment", approve transaction]**

"Payment released instantly on Base. Transaction cost? About one-tenth of a cent.

The AI agent posts the final receipt. Job complete."

---

## [2:20-2:50] THE TECH

"So what powers this?

**Civic** - our only authentication provider. Embedded wallets, one-tap login.

**XMTP** - decentralized messaging. The AI agent uses the Agent SDK to coordinate everything.

**Base** - Layer 2 blockchain. Fast, cheap transactions.

**ENS** - identity throughout the app. Makes addresses human.

**Calimero** - private compute with attestations for sensitive work.

And **GPT-4** - the AI brain. It has function calling, queries the smart contract, understands natural language, and generates transaction links.

This isn't just a chatbot. The AI actively manages blockchain state."

---

## [2:50-3:00] WRAP UP
