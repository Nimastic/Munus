## Base - $5.000

  

Base is an open stack built to empower builders, creators, and people everywhere to build apps, grow businesses, create what they love, and earn onchain.

  

The three parts of the Base stack work together to support the future of an open, global economy for everyone:

  

- **Base Chain**: An open network for the global economy. Formerly just ‚ÄúBase,‚Äù the secure, fast, and low-cost Ethereum L2, built on the Superchain empowering a global onchain economy at scale. With Flashblocks, we‚Äôre reducing effective block times from 2 seconds to just 200 milliseconds, making Base Chain 10x faster. [Learn more](https://www.base.org/).

- **Base Build**: Our continued commitment to fostering a vibrant builder ecosystem at [base.org/build](http://base.org/build). Base Build will continue to provide builders with the tools and support they need to create the next wave of onchain experiences. This includes the new [Base Build dashboard](http://base.dev/) that help teams build, grow, and monetize their mini apps.

- **Base App**: Your new home, onchain. Built on open protocols, the next evolution of Coinbase Wallet is more than a wallet, it‚Äôs where you create, earn, trade, discover apps and chat with friends all in one place. The next version is in beta now. Join the waitlist at [base.app](https://base.app/).

  

*If you need a **code** to **skip the waitlist**, make sure to come to our booth!*

  

### **Miniapps**

  

The next evolution of digital experiences extends beyond app stores into social feeds and direct messages. Mini Apps are lightweight, social-native apps that launch instantly when you tap them: no downloads, no friction, just immediate engagement. While the Base App provides the discoverability through social distribution and featured listings, Mini Apps deliver the frictionless experience that makes instant trial and viral sharing possible.
