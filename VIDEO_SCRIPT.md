## Script

### [0:00-0:15] HOOK (15 seconds)

**[Screen: Split screen - frustrated freelancer waiting, creator worried]**

> "Freelancers wait days for payment. Creators risk non-delivery. Teams waste hours switching between chat, invoicing, and payment apps."

**[Screen: Munus logo animates in]**

> "What if work and payment happened... in chat?"

---

### [0:15-0:30] PROBLEM (15 seconds)

**[Screen: Stats appear]**

> "The $1.5 trillion freelance economy is broken:
> - 20% platform fees
> - 14-day payment delays
> - Zero trust guarantees
> - Small businesses can't accept crypto"

**[Screen: Red X's over traditional platforms]**

> "There has to be a better way."

---

### [0:30-1:00] SOLUTION (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Munus interface fades in]**

> "Meet Munus - chat-native jobs where AI coordinates and blockchain secures payment."

**[Screen: 4-step animation]**

> "Here's how it works:
> 
> **One:** Login with Civic - one tap, instant embedded wallet.
> 
> **Two:** Post a job in your XMTP group chat - funds lock in Base escrow automatically.
> 
> **Three:** AI agent coordinates everything - reminders, receipts, transaction links.
> 
> **Four:** Deliver work, get paid instantly. No invoicing. No waiting. No trust required."
