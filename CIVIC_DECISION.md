# üîë Civic SSO Decision

## Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **We removed Civic embedded wallets due to Turnkey iframe issues**

Now using: **Simple wallet connection** (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)

---

## ‚ùì Do We Still Need Civic?

The Civic bounty ($2,000) requires:
- ‚úÖ **Civic Auth as ONLY SSO**
- ‚úÖ Embedded wallets (bonus, not strictly required)
- ‚úÖ Agentic capabilities
- ‚úÖ Public demo
- ‚úÖ Video

---

## üéØ Three Options

### **Option 1: Add Civic SSO (without embedded wallets)** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

**What it means:**
- User logs in with Civic (Google/Email through Civic)
- Civic provides identity/profile
- User ALSO connects their MetaMask wallet
- Two separate systems working together

**Changes needed:**
1. Install `@civic/auth` (NOT `@civic/auth-web3`)
2. Wrap app in `<CivicAuthProvider>`
3. Show "Login with Civic" button
4. Still show "Connect Wallet" separately

**Time:** ~20 minutes

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Qualifies for $2,000 Civic bounty
- ‚úÖ No Turnkey issues
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Users do two steps (login + connect wallet)
- ‚ùå Extra complexity

---

### **Option 2: Skip Civic Entirely** ‚ö° FASTEST

**What it means:**
- No Civic integration at all
- Just wallet connection

**Changes needed:**
- None! Already done

**Time:** 0 minutes (done!)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Works immediately
- ‚úÖ Simple UX
- ‚úÖ No integration issues

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Lose $2,000 Civic bounty
- ‚ùå Still have $16,500+ other bounties

---

### **Option 3: Document Turnkey Issue** üìù HONEST

**What it means:**
- Keep embedded wallet code
- Add clear documentation explaining Turnkey/CSP issue
- Show judges you understand the problem
- Note it's a known integration challenge

**Changes needed:**
1. Add troubleshooting section to README
2. Document Turnkey iframe issue
3. Explain it's solvable in production

**Time:** ~10 minutes

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Honest about challenges
- ‚úÖ Shows technical understanding
- ‚úÖ Might still qualify for bounty

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Judges might not accept
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Demo won't work smoothly

---

## üí≠ My Recommendation

**For maximum prize potential: Option 1**

Add Civic SSO (the simple `@civic/auth` package) alongside wallet connection.

**Why:**
- $2,000 bounty vs 20 minutes of work = great ROI
- Clean implementation
- No Turnkey headaches
- Two-step UX is acceptable (login ‚Üí connect wallet)

**For fastest ship: Option 2**

Skip Civic, focus on making everything else perfect.

**Why:**
- Still targeting $16,500+ in other bounties
- No complexity
- More time for polish

## üöÄ What Do You Want To Do?

Tell me:

1. **Option 1** - Add Civic SSO (I'll implement it quickly)
2. **Option 2** - Skip Civic (we're done, ready to commit!)
3. **Option 3** - Document the issue (I'll write good docs)

**Or** - Focus on deployment first, add Civic later if time permits?

---

## üìã If You Choose Option 1 (Civic SSO)

Here's what I'll do:

```bash
# 1. Install Civic Auth (simple package)
cd apps/miniapp
pnpm add @civic/auth

# 2. Update providers.tsx
# - Add <CivicAuthProvider>
# - Show login state

# 3. Update homepage
# - Add "Login with Civic" button
# - Keep "Connect Wallet" separate
# - Show both states

# 4. Test
# - Login works
# - Wallet works
# - Both work together
```

**Time estimate: 15-20 minutes**
